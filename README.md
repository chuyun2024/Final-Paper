# 🛡️ Understanding the Risk of Casualties in US School Shootings

## 📘 Overview

This paper analyzes the likelihood of casualties in school shooting incidents across the United States using a Bayesian Logistic Regression model and historical data spanning from 1999 onward. By examining key predictors such as shooting type and geographic latitude, the study identifies factors that significantly influence casualty risks. The results provide actionable strategies for improving school safety, including enhanced threat assessment programs and stricter firearm regulations.

## 🌟 Motivation

The persistent and devastating issue of school shootings in the United States necessitates a proactive, evidence-based approach. This project is designed to harness the power of predictive modeling to move beyond reactive policies, enabling more effective safety interventions and casualty prevention strategies for school communities.

## 💡 Key Findings

- **Increased Risks from Certain Shooting Types:** Targeted and indiscriminate shootings are associated with significantly higher casualty probabilities, highlighting the importance of focused prevention efforts.
- **Geographic Influence on Casualty Likelihood:** The location of school shootings, particularly geographic latitude, plays a measurable role in determining casualty risks.
- **Policy and Safety Measures:** Findings support implementing stricter firearm regulations, proactive threat assessment programs, and improved mental health resources.
